# HTTP Server for Android
I have updated this version of a HTTP Server example, that i followed online.

## Main Project Added
### New Changes,
- Permission Acceptance for Android 6.0+
- Storage Permission for Serving Web pages from the SD Card
- Notifications Added for Server Status
- Server wrapped in a Service to help it run effectively
- Updated Target API and Build SDK versions
- Converted to a Gradle build version

This application template was very old and had no support for Android 9.0, i wanted to freshen it up
a bit with some improvements.

The original template was released without a license or information on the creator, so i have added
it under MIT License as it seems to be Public Domain, this will allow anyone to use it. kind regards.



### Live Demo - Testers, only tested on Android 9.0
